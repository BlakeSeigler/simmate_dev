## Expected duration
If you are comfortable with python, tutorials 00-05 should take under **1 hour in total**. Tutorials 06-09 will take **2-3 hours in total** but are optional features.

If you are new to coding, we recommend you complete **one tutorial per day (1-2 hrs each)**. This includes exploring extra resources in each tutorial. Keep in mind that tutorials 06-09 are advanced topics but also completely optional.
