# Simmate Tutorials

Welcome! These tutorials should help you get familiar with Simmate -- whether you're new to coding or an expert user. 

> :warning: Many tutorials are incomplete at the moment, but they'll be finished by the time we release our code to the public.

> A quick comment on tutorials... All tutorials will have two sections: a short-and-to-the-point one for experts and a much longer one for beginners. The critical steps in each are **exactly the same**. However, the full tutorial includes extra exploration of the software and how to use it. For example, this tutorial includes a guide on the command-line as well as concepts of python enviornments and working directories. Be sure to read the full tutorials if you don't have coding experience!
