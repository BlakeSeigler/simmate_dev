This is an SQL executor that intends to be a stripped down version of FireWorks. I really like how the database queue server makes it so you don't have to deal with firewalls -- any worker that can connect to the database will work just fine. This is a big step up over Dask, where I need to mess with ports and firewalls.

I really want to find an executor that's a happy-medium though between Dask and a DatabaseServer executor. It needs to be fast, easily configured for a single computer or many distributed, and also have one-directional workers to avoid firewalls/porting setups. Executor libraries based on Rabbitmq or Reddis might be able to do this, but I'm not sure yet. So far, the setup of Rabbitmq and Reddis looks like more work than I would like but may be worth investigating. So far the most popular package for this looks to be Celery, whereas a simple implementation for me could be django-carrot.
