This module is empty at the moment, but I plan for it to be a fork of matminer in the future. For now, I just use this package as dependencies directly. Alternatively, I can see this becoming a "datamine" module that is really just a wrapper for accessing data of other online material databases. In that case, it may make more sense to absorb this into the database module. This is analogous to pymatgen.ext module
