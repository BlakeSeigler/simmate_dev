# Release History

Simmate releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This means versions numbers (e.g. v1.2.3) correspond to MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

  - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
  - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
  - PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

There is one key exception to the rules above -- and that is with MAJOR=0 releases. Any v0.x.y release is considered developmental where APIs are subject to change and should not be considered stable. *(This is consistent with the semantic version spec. See [point 4](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).)*
